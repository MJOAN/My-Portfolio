### Portfolio!
This is my portfolio and represents a culmination of all projects I've built as a student of the UCLA Full Stack Developer Certificate Program from August 2017 to February 2018. This will also include my social media, technical resume and a way to contact me for developer purposes. Please see important information from Start Bootstrap who was the creator of this Bootstrap Agency one page template! I've edited this template to include all relevant information for my projects, including Heroku and or GitPages live hosted sites. Thank you for reading this ReadMe.md and have an amazing day!
